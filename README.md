# threaded-atm-demo

John wants to demonstrate the working of multithreading. For that, he wants to make one demo of the ATM application, which has the functionality of checking balances, withdrawing money, and depositing a certain amount at the same time from two different places. If we do the transaction, how is it implemented using the threads?
Based on the above given use case and using the concepts of multithreading, arrays, classes, and methods, create an application implementing the functions of showing balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money and create two user threads that will call these methods from two different places, means two threads working at the same time.In java
